Thank you for downloading Freshwaterfish pack.

This is a semi realistic 3d model and animations of Freshwaterfish. 
In the following * is each model's name(e.g. Angelfish).

-*/Models folder contains  FBX files of models
-*/Textures folder contains textures.
-*/Animations folder contains FBX files of animations.
These are main contents of this package.
Other contents are just example of use.

JSFreshwaterfish/Scenes folders contains example use of the Freshwaterfish pack.
JSFreshwaterfish/Animator folder contains animator controller that is overrided to each model's animator.
JSFreshwaterfish/Scripts folder contains scripts that used in the demo.

*/Prefabs folder contains prefabs that used in the demo.

Hence if you use prefabs of angelfish, you must import Angelfish folder, Scripts folder and Animator folder.
